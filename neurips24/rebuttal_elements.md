As we estimate the velocity of the system based on executing finite differences in image-space, applying larger damping terms is actually quite challenging
and leads to some noise in the control input. Again, this is not a limitation of the FF term, but instead a challenge common
to all methods conducting control on (low-resolution) image observations.
